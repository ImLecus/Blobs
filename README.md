# Blobs

### What is Blobs?

Blobs is a natural selection simulator that i'm developing with React. The blobs will be the creatures that will be the protagonists of this experiment. 
The objective of this project is to make a complete natural selection simulator, with an options panel for customization, a statistics panel to see graphycally
the changes on every generation and the main window where the blobs will be surviving (or not) generation after generation!
